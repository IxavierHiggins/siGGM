# structurally informed Gaussian Graphical Model package (siGGM)

The structurally informed Gaussian Graphical Model (siGGM), is a R package provides a method for integrating structural connectivity (SC) information into the estimation of functional connectivity (FC). The package currently supports functional connectivity estimation as described in Higgins et al. (2018). 

## Usage

In R/RStudio, run the following code to download and install the package from the github repository:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IxavierHiggins/siGGMrepo")
library(siGGM)
```

The R package provides examples of how to use the two primary functions, SCFC and SCFCpath. Both can be easily accessed with the following commands:

```
?SCFC
?SCFCpath
```

## Toolboxes Included

The siGGM package incorporates the structural connectivity information into the estimation of functional connectivity via two well-established R packages:
 
* [glasso] (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glasso) - Estimates FC using Coordinate block descent.
* [QUIC] (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=QUIC) - Estimate FC using quadratic approximation.
* [igraph] (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph) - Used to simulate data under specified network structures.

## Version

siGGM is currently in version 0.1.0
